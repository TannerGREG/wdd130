                 <ul>
                   <li><p>I thought of a fun theme and decided to have it based arround that theme, with the focus being the QR code I provided to be on the main Page</p></li>
                    <li><p>I emailed him the site plan at the begining of the project and got a response yesterday (7/16/25) I also asked for the link, but he hasn't sent it yet</p></li>
                    <li><p>I haven't seen it yet...</p></li>
                    <li><p>talk to him in person every few days offering help</p></li>
                </ul>

                <h2> Lead Dev Report</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>I told each of them their tasts at the beginning and making sure they had access to the github and put the siteplan in there, with instructions in the readme file</p></li>
                    <li><p>I never communicated with my client... even though there where no photos other than the logo, I just generated sample photos online...</p></li>
                    <li><p>I did email my client the link to the site</p></li>
                    <li><p>I never really had problems managing the github on this site, and both the junior devs made and uploaded a page</p></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>I talked to the lead dev in class, the site plan was a little late getting finished, but after it was finished I wasn't given acess till today (7/17/25)</p></li>
                    <li><p>Again I didn't know what to do till today...</p></li>
                    <li><p>I did the About us page, I used a nav from the index though, but I changed the color pallet for my page to better match the color pallet in the site plan</p></li>
                </ul>

                <h2> Junior Dev Report</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>I got all the info from an email, and was added to the github where there were assigments in the READ.ME </p></li>
                    <li><p>YES my part was clear</p></li>
                    <li><p>I origanly coppied the githib instead of joining it, so that was annoying, but luckley they mentioned that they couldn't see any of my changes, and we got it figured out</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>I did the About Me page on this site too. Also in vscode with live server the photo loads, but not when using the github link, I'm not sure whats up with that</p>

                <h2>Things Learned Report</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The most Challenging part was getting in contact with my groupmates, and having to wait for instructions/other people to get their part done</p></li>
                    <li><p>The part I enjoyed most in the project was learning how to host sites on GitHub</p></li>
                    <li><p>If I where to do the project agian, I check in more with the people in my groups, and make sure I remeber their faces when we are first assigned.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I'm not sure if I feel more confident, but I did release just how important communication is.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>I learned that communication is Key in group projects especially during the beginning. It was a mess trying to get figure out who was who... I also found that it is very important to stay up to date on your tasks so that you don't delay other people</p>
